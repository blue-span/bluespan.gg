What is the giveaway schedule?
------------------------------

These giveaways are planned:

- 8 Dec 2019
- 22 Dec 2019

Why do you want one of these?
-----------------------------

To play Dota 2, obviously.

- runs Dota 2 at approximately 90fps @ medium @ 1080p [2]_ (or better)
- latest AMD Ryzen 3rd-gen 3000 7nm series CPUs
- very quiet cooling, due to the included Noctua coolers
- small/compact physical size: the smallest build we are giving away is 155 x 155 x 80 mm (1.92L)

Why AMD/Ryzen/Vega/Navi?
------------------------

- AMD's 7nm manufacturing process yields thermal properties vastly superior to equivalent Intel parts
- AMD's Vega and Navi GPUs support FreeSync, a royalty-free VESA standard to eliminate screen tearing
- AMD is significantly less cunty compared to Nvidia [3]_.

What parts are included?
------------------------

The exact build specifications are subject to change arbitrarily and without notice. Here is one possible example build:

- AMD Ryzen 5 3400G with Radeon RX Vega 11 Graphics
- G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4-3200 16GB (2x8 GB) 18-18-18-43
- SAMSUNG 970 EVO M.2 2280 500GB PCIe Gen3 4x
- ASRock A300M-STX [4]_ motherboard
- ASRock DeskMini A300 chassis (1.92L SFF)
- Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 cooler
- Intel AC-3168 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0

The above build has been tested and can run Dota 2 at approximately 90fps @ medium @ 1080p

Another possible build for later in the giveaway (the Santa Claus™ edition):

- AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- Radeon RX 5500 (Navi 14)
- MSI B450I Gaming Plus AC motherboard
- DDR4-3466+; at least 16GB
- GEEEK A50 Mini-ITX case (9.7L SFF)
- CORSAIR SF Series SF600

What parts are not included?
----------------------------

If you are a caveman with no possessions other than your pet rock, to use one of
these you'll need to come up with:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Monitor
- Headphones

.. note:: If a mod happens to win (and was a mod prior to winning), they will be
   eligible to recieve these items based on need.

.. note:: All Blue Span mods *that have played more than one on-stream party
   game* are eligible to receive a free headset or microphone+boom of your
   choice. Standard issue for mods is:

   - https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-pro (recommended)
