How to edit
-----------

Source files are in the source_ directory in this repository.

For quick editing, you can edit directly on GitHub.

Files are published on bluespan.gg relative to where they exist in the `source`
directory. For example, `source/test/foo.rst`_ becomes
https://bluespan.gg/test/foo when published.

If you want to do basic formatting, but don't know what rst is, there are
several resources:

- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html
- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

If you want fancier formatting or custom styling, ask arS3Nf2z7DSc01 for help.

Note that changes are published automatically to bluespan.gg as soon as they are
committed to the `master` branch on github (with a short delay).
